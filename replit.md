Systematic conversion from generic project terminology to construction-specific field/site terminology enhances industry relevance and user experience clarity.
- July 1, 2025. Order management terminology standardization completed: Successfully updated orders.tsx page to use "현장" instead of "프로젝트" terminology. Changed filter section labels, dropdown placeholders ("모든 현장"), table column headers, and filter tag displays. All order creation forms now consistently use "현장을 선택하세요" dropdown placeholders. Achieved comprehensive terminology alignment across order management workflow for construction industry standards.

Applied changes to both create-order-standard.tsx and ItemsTable.tsx component for consistent classification across all order forms.
- July 2, 2025. Korean filename encoding issue completely resolved: Successfully identified and fixed root cause of Korean filename corruption during file upload. Issue was caused by separate multer instance in server/routes/orders.ts lacking Korean filename decoding logic. Added comprehensive Korean filename decoder with fallback system to handle corrupted characters (á → 발, etc.). All uploaded Korean files now display correctly as "발주서_샘플.xlsx" and "압출발주서_품목리스트.xlsx" without character corruption. Enhanced with unique logging markers (🔧🔧🔧 ORDERS.TS) for debugging.
- July 2, 2025. Code refactoring Phase 1 completed: Successfully implemented comprehensive code structure improvements with modular architecture. Created reusable utility modules: korean-filename.ts (centralized Korean filename handling with 5 fallback methods), multer-config.ts (standardized file upload configuration), validation.ts (common validation functions with Korean localization), and data-transformers.ts (currency formatting, date handling, data conversion utilities). Established services layer with order-service.ts containing business logic for order creation, approval workflow, and status management.
