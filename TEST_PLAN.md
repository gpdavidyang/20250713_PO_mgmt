# Purchase Order Management System - Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Purchase Order Management System (구매 발주 관리 시스템).

## Testing Scope

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Authentication Module**
  - User login/logout functionality
  - Session management
  - Password hashing and verification
  - Role-based access control

- **Vendor Management**
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Data validation
  - Duplicate vendor detection
  - Vendor search functionality

- **Purchase Order Module**
  - Order creation and validation
  - Item management within orders
  - Status workflow transitions
  - Approval authority verification
  - Order history tracking

- **Excel Processing**
  - File upload validation
  - Sheet extraction logic
  - Data parsing accuracy
  - Format preservation
  - Error handling for invalid formats

### 2. Integration Testing
- **API Endpoints**
  - `/api/auth/*` - Authentication flow
  - `/api/orders/*` - Order management
  - `/api/vendors/*` - Vendor operations
  - `/api/dashboard/*` - Statistics and reporting
  - `/api/excel-automation/*` - Excel processing pipeline

- **Database Integration**
  - Drizzle ORM operations
  - Transaction handling
  - Data consistency
  - Foreign key constraints

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Critical User Workflows**
  - User registration and login
  - Creating a new purchase order
  - Multi-level approval process
  - Excel file upload and processing
  - Email notification sending
  - Dashboard data visualization

### 4. Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**
  - Response time under load
  - Concurrent user handling
  - Large dataset processing
  - Excel file processing speed

- **Security Testing**
  - Authentication bypass attempts
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - File upload security
  - Session hijacking prevention

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install test dependencies
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest supertest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest @vitest/ui
```

### Test Database
- Separate test database instance
- Test data fixtures for consistent testing
- Database reset between test suites

### Mock Services
- Email service mocking
- External API mocking
- File system mocking for uploads

## Test Data

### User Accounts
- Admin user: `admin@test.com`
- Project Manager: `pm@test.com`
- Field Worker: `worker@test.com`
- Executive: `exec@test.com`

### Sample Data
- 10 test vendors with various validation states
- 5 test projects
- 20 test purchase orders in different statuses
- Excel templates for testing

## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. Configure Jest/Vitest for TypeScript
2. Set up test database
3. Create test utilities and helpers
4. Configure test environment variables

### Phase 2: Unit Tests
1. Backend services and utilities
2. Database operations
3. Frontend components
4. Custom hooks and utilities

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
1. API endpoint testing
2. Database transaction testing
3. File upload/download testing
4. Email service integration

### Phase 4: E2E Tests
1. Critical path scenarios
2. Error scenarios
3. Edge cases

### Phase 5: Non-Functional Tests
1. Load testing with k6 or similar
2. Security scanning with OWASP tools
3. Performance profiling

## Success Criteria
- Unit test coverage: >80%
- Integration test coverage: >70%
- All critical paths covered by E2E tests
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Response time <200ms for standard operations
- Excel processing <5s for files up to 10MB

## Risk Mitigation
- **Database State**: Use transactions and rollback for test isolation
- **External Dependencies**: Mock all external services
- **File System**: Use temporary directories for file operations
- **Concurrent Tests**: Ensure proper test isolation

## Continuous Integration
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on pull requests
- Run E2E tests before deployment
- Generate coverage reports
- Fail builds on test failures

## Test Maintenance
- Update tests when features change
- Review and update test data regularly
- Monitor test execution time
- Refactor flaky tests
- Document test patterns and utilities
