# Attachment Download Issue - Deployment Status

## Problem Summary
- **Issue**: Attachments returning 404 errors when downloading (IDs 115-160)
- **Root Cause**: Database import bug prevented `file_data` from being saved
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected import pattern in all PDF services (commit 029b6c8)

## Current Status (as of 2025-09-06 10:45 KST)
- ✅ **Code Fixed**: Import pattern corrected from `import * as db` to `import { db }`
- ✅ **Committed & Pushed**: All fixes pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ **Awaiting Deployment**: Vercel needs to deploy the latest code
- ❌ **Attachments 115-160**: Will remain broken (no file_data)
- ✅ **Future Attachments**: Will work correctly once deployed

## What's Fixed
1. **Professional PDF Service**: Now correctly saves Base64 data
2. **Excel Attachment Service**: Properly encodes and saves file data
3. **POTemplateProcessorMock**: Uses Professional PDF format

## Verification Steps
After deployment completes:
1. Create new order via Excel upload
2. Check attachments have file_data: 
   ```sql
   SELECT id, original_name, 
          CASE WHEN file_data IS NOT NULL THEN 'OK' ELSE 'ERROR' END as status
   FROM attachments WHERE id > 160;
   ```
3. Test download functionality for both PDF and Excel files

## Monitoring
- Check deployment: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Monitor new attachments: Run `monitor-deployment.sql`
- Latest attachment ID: 160 (all before this are affected)

## Professional PDF Features
The Professional PDF includes:
- Company header with full business details
- Vendor information section
- Project and delivery details
- Itemized list with specifications
- Financial summary (subtotal, VAT, total)
- Attachment count and email history
- Professional formatting and layout

## Timeline
- 10:26 - Issue reported with attachments 147-148
