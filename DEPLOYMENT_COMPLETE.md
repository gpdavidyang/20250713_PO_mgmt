- **Previous Bundle**: `attached-files-info-DIRIetSw-1757155224687.js`

## Current Situation

### ❌ Broken Attachments (Will NOT work)
- **IDs 115-162**: These attachments have NULL file_data
- **Created Before**: Deployment completion
- **Status**: Permanently broken (unless manually fixed)

### ✅ New Attachments (Will work)

1. Go to "발주서 작성" (Create Order)
2. Click "엑셀 업로드 입력" (Excel Upload)
3. Upload Excel file
4. Complete order creation

### 2. Verify Success
After creating new order, check:
```sql
SELECT id, original_name, 
       CASE WHEN file_data IS NOT NULL THEN '✅ OK' ELSE '❌ ERROR' END as status
FROM attachments 
WHERE id > 162;
```

### 3. Test Downloads
- Click PDF download - should work
- Click Excel download - should work
- Both files should download successfully

## What Was Fixed
1. **Database Import Pattern**: Fixed `import * as db` → `import { db }`
