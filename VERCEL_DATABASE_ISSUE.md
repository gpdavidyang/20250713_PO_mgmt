# Vercel Deployment 500 Error - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem
Login endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error on Vercel deployment while working fine in localhost.

## Root Cause
The DATABASE_URL environment variable is not configured in Vercel deployment settings.

### Evidence Found:
1. **Hardcoded credentials in db.ts** (SECURITY ISSUE - NOW REMOVED)
   - The code previously had a hardcoded database URL with exposed password
   - This was being used as a fallback when DATABASE_URL was not set

2. **Process.exit() in serverless environment**
   - The db.ts file was calling `process.exit(1)` when DATABASE_URL was missing
   - In Vercel serverless functions, this causes the entire function to crash
   - This resulted in 500 error instead of proper error message

## Solution

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Add DATABASE_URL to Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard > Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add: `DATABASE_URL` with your Supabase pooler connection string
   - Format: `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]`
   - Use the Supabase **pooler** URL (not direct connection) for serverless compatibility

2. **Add JWT_SECRET to Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Add: `JWT_SECRET` with a secure random string
   - This is required for JWT token generation

### Code Changes Made:
1. **Removed hardcoded database credentials** (CRITICAL SECURITY FIX)
2. **Improved error handling for missing DATABASE_URL**
   - No longer calls `process.exit()` in Vercel environment
   - Returns clear error messages about missing configuration
3. **Added database availability checks in storage methods**
   - Prevents cryptic errors when database is not available
4. **Enhanced logging** to help diagnose environment issues

## Verification Steps:
1. Add DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET to Vercel environment variables
2. Redeploy the application
3. Check Vercel function logs for any remaining errors
4. Test login functionality

## Security Note:
The hardcoded database password that was exposed in the code should be changed immediately in your Supabase dashboard for security.
